   SPICE: Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments
   =============================================================

SPICE is a remote display system built for virtual environments which
allows you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the
machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and
from a wide variety of machine architectures.

Installation
------------

The SPICE package uses GNU autotools, so the build install process
follows the standard process documented in the INSTALL file. As a
quick start you can do

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
  make
  sudo make install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/spice
  make
  make install

The following mandatory dependancies are required in order to
build SPICE

    Spice protocol >= 0.9.0
    Celt           >= 0.5.1.1, < 0.6.0
    Pixman         >= 0.17.7
    OpenSSL
    libjpeg
    zlib
    Cyrus-SASL

The following optional dependancies increase the available
functionality

    GE Gui         >= 0.6.0,  < 0.7.0   (GUI app support)
    OpenGL                              (GUI app support)
    Alsa                                (Linux support)
    XRandR         >= 1.2               (X11 support)
    Xinerama       >= 1.0               (X11 support)
    libcacard      >= 0.1.2             (Smartcard support)
    Slirp                               (Tunnelling support)

Communication
-------------

To communicate with the development team, or to post patches
there is a technical mailing list:

To view known bugs, or report new bugs, in SPICE visit

   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Spice

Bugs found when using an OS distribution's binary packages should
be reported to the OS vendors' own bug tracker first.
