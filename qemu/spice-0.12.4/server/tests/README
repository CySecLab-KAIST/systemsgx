What is here
============

This directory will contain a testsuite for the server including tetris drawing.

Unfortunately tetris and most of the tests are not here right now. You can however run all the tests and use libtool to debug any of them thus:

libtool --mode=execute gdb test_just_sockets_no_ssl

Overview of tests
=================

test_just_sockets_no_ssl
 A complete server, only provides the main and inputs channels. Doesn't actually produce anything on the channels. Essentially a test of the regular link code (reds.c), good for multiple connect/disconnect tests.

test_empty_success
 tests calling

test_fail_on_null_core_interface
 should abort when run (when spice tries to watch_add)

basic_event_loop.c
 used by test_just_sockets_no_ssl, can be used by other tests. very crude event loop. Should probably use libevent for better tests, but this is self contained.

Automated tests
===============

test_display_streaming.c
 this test can be used to check regressions. For this, Spice needs to be compiled with --enable-automated-tests and test_display_streaming needs to be called passing --automated-tests as parameter
